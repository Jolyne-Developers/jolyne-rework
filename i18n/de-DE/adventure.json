  "ADVENTURE_COMPLETE": "{{emojis.happyjolyne}}**__Jolyne:__** Nice, your adventure is starting now !\n\nüî∏Some items were added into your inventory:\n ‚Üí `Stand Arrow (x1)` {{emojis.mysterious_arrow}}\n ‚Üí `Pizza (x5)` {{emojis.complete_pizza}} \n ‚Üí `Coins (+1,500)` {{emojis.jocoins}}\n\n\n**__QUICK TUTORIAL__**\n\n{{emojis.arrowRight}} **How do I complete my chapter quests ? How do I see them ?**\n ‚Ä¢ You can view your chapter quests by using the {{command.chapter}} command. If it says that you have to defeat an NPC, then use the {{command.fight npc}} command. Make sure to use your stand arrow in your inventory first ({{command.inventory use}})\n\n{{emojis.arrowRight}} **How do I regenerate myself**\n ‚Ä¢ You currently have 5 pizzas in your inventory. Use the {{command.inventory use}} command and select a pizza. If you don't have any consumable items left, buy some by using the {{command.shop}} command.\n\n{{emojis.arrowRight}} **How do I become stronger ?**\n ‚Ä¢ When you level up, you gain 4 skill points. You can invest your skill points to get stronger (more damages, better perception, better speed, more health). Since you're level 1, you currently have 4 skill points. Use the {{command.skill points}} command to invest your skill points.\n\n{{emojis.arrowRight}} **How do I level up quickly ?**\n ‚Ä¢ The best way to level up is by completing your chapter quests and/or your daily quests. Use the {{command.chapter}} to view your chapter quests (storyline) and {{command.daily quests}} to view your daily quests.\n\n**Need further help ?**\n‚ñ∂Ô∏è Join my support server here: https://discord.gg/9a2HYsum2v",
